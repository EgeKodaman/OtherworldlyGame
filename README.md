# OtherworldlyGame
 My first game ever, made with the knowledge gained from following the Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D course on Udemy by GameDev.tv
 
 Before finishing the last section of the course I felt comfortable enough to challenge myself to make a game from scratch, and add the mechanics and functionalities that I wanted. This allowed me to overcome the roadblocks that I encountered while adding certain features myself and resulted in me learning a lot from this little project.
 
 I used Warped Caves asset pack by Ansimuz for this game.
